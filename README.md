06/03/23           : Testing NB-IoT Connectivity with Magellan 
                     
                     Sending Packet from Board and Ploting it on Dashboard (Success)
                     Tested differnt codes given by AIS to send and recieve data via Magellan_SIM7020E Link (https://github.com/AIS-DeviceInnovation/Magellan_SIM7020E)
                     Sending data using UDPSIM7020E (Fail: Unable to recive data on NodeRed)
