<p>Embedded Software Design:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Last week, I encountered an issue where I was unable to send data to Node-RED. To resolve this issue, I purchased a server with an IPv4 address from the Digital Ocean website. I deployed an Ubuntu droplet on Digital Ocean and am running Node-RED on it. I am now successfully able to receive data on Node-RED at a speed of 1 second. However, I am currently unable to send data from Node-RED to the board.</li>
</ul>

<p>Embedded Software Design:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Last week, I attempted to establish a connection with the Hivemq public broker using MQTT. I used AT commands via serial hardware to subscribe and publish data to the broker. I then used the AIS-provided MQTT code PUBSUB to connect to Node-RED. However, I encountered an issue where the ESP32 kept restarting instead of connecting with the broker. To resolve this issue, I downgraded the ESP32 core to version 1.06. I am now successfully sending and receiving data using MQTT on Node-RED.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Date: April 03, 2023</h2>
<p>Embedded Software Design:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Last week, a significant milestone was achieved as we combined the hardware and software. We were able to send the weight by pressing a button. However, after connecting the load sensor, we encountered an issue where the data was not being sent to the server. We debugged the issue and found that the SPI pin used for the load sensor was actually the NB-IoT reset pin. This caused our device to reset when we tried to read weight. We updated the payload message and incorporated the date and time variable in the JSON frame. We were successfully able to get the current time and date via the NB-IoT board. The JSON data received at the payload was parsed, and a simple GUI was made to display the current values.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Date: April 10, 2023</h2>
<p>Embedded Software Design:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We tested the Interdigital Capacitor (IDC) based volume sensor using the the Nyanyan/FastCapacitiveSensor: Fast Capacitive Sensor Library (github.com). The code requires a 10M Ohm resistor connected with IDC sensor, but we tested it with a 2MOhm resistor that we had available. Unfortunately, the test showed that the IDC values were not incrementing with the increasing water level. The sensor was sensitive to detecting whether the electrode was dipped in water or not, but the traces of water on the sensor also affected the values, so the sensor needed to be cleaned again to return to the initial value.</li>
  <li>We also tested the OEM HW-038 Water level Sensor, which worked more or less the same as our sensor, only detecting the presence of water but not helping in detecting the level or volume. Further analysis with an oscilloscope and more testing with different values of resistor are needed to proceed further.</li>
  <li>We also tested the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and used it to detect the water level in a glass of water. The sensor is working fine, and calibration needs to be done to be used to detect the volume in a glass of water.</li>
</ul>
